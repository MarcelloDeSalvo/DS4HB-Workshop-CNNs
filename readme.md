## :page_with_curl: Intro
Rodent models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are crucial for studying the mechanisms underlying brain injury evolution and long-term outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in preclinical settings to monitor in-vivo structural damage, as it allows direct comparisons to human data. However, automatic segmentation of brain volumes remains challenging due to the scarcity of rodent brain segmentation methods, making the procedure highly time-consuming and operator-dependent

By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this study aims to develop an efficient tool for enhancing segmentation quality while minimizing analysis time. We explore the effectiveness of 3D CNN architectures across different species, strains, injury sites, and MRI sequences: using a dataset of rodents with TBI from the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, we trained and evaluated a multi-task CNN incorporating multi-scale inputs, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms to enhance segmentation performance.

## :mouse: 3D R-Net Architecture
Our proposed multi-task 3D U-Net architecture features:

- **Shared Encoder and Decoder**: A unified pathway for efficient learning, with a total of 7.4 million parameters.
- **Skip Connections**: To transfer matching feature maps from the encoder to the decoder.
- **Self-Attention Layers**: Feature maps in the decoder are processed with self-attention layers for enhanced precision.
- **Deep Supervision**: Intermediate results are summed up separately for each task, ensuring precise and fine-grained 3D segmentation.
- **Multi-scale inputs**: Preserves small or subtle image details that are frequently lost during max-pooling by gradually incorporating multi-scale inputs into the encoder layers.

## :wrench: Project setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
```python
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
#### Venv environment
Create and activate a virtual environment using VS Code commands.

1. Open VS Code and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run the following commands:
    - `Python: Create Environment`
    - Choose `Venv`
    - Select `requirements.txt` to automatically install dependencies

#### Conda Environment with GPU support for TF 2.10 (Recommended)
To create a Conda environment with GPU support for TensorFlow 2.10, follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda or Miniconda**:  
   Ensure you have Conda or Miniconda installed on your system.<br>
   You can download Miniconda from [miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. **Create and Set Up the Environment**:  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
```python
conda create --name your_env python==3.10.13
conda activate your_env
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Configure VS Code for Jupyter Notebook
Ensure you have the necessary extensions in VS Code:
- Python
- Jupyter

Open VS Code, navigate to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`, and search for and install the Python and Jupyter extensions.

### 4. Open and Run Jupyter Notebook
To open and run your Jupyter Notebook:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Python: Select Interpreter`. Choose the interpreter from your virtual environment (it should be named `venv`).

2. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `notebook.ipynb`) within VS Code and open it.

3. Run the notebook cells to execute your TensorFlow code with CUDA support.

### 5. Verify TensorFlow with CUDA
To ensure TensorFlow is using CUDA, run the following code in a Jupyter Notebook cell:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```
